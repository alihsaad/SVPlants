I just want to say I am unfamiliar with the back-end language and framework used and was so busy with job interviews, that I did not have time to have this assessment be feature complete. I will still attempt to finish it if I have the time.

=====================
-download .NET 5.0 
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download //.NET download 

-download repo files 

-open terminal where the files reside and run: "dotnet build" to check out the REST API
